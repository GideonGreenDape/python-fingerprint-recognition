# Python Fingerprint Recognition

Backend authentication using python as a child process in MERN Fingerprint recognition with SKimage and OpenCV

Requirements:
- NumPy
- SKimage
- OpenCV2


Works by extracting minutiae points using harris corner detection.

Uses SIFT (ORB) go get formal descriptors around the keypoints with brute-force hamming distance and then analyzes the returned matches using thresholds.
